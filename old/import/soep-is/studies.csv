The research infrastructure SOEP at DIW Berlin established a longitudinal Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) in 2011 for particularly innovative research projects. The SOEP-IS is primarily available for methodical and thematic research that involves too much of a risk of high non-response rates for the long-term SOEP study. 

SOEP-IS:

* is based on the evaluation conducted by the Science Council.
* is a longitudinal sample for particularly innovative survey methods and behavioral experiments.
* will be established in the period from 2012 to 2017 and should be fully developed by 2017.

The annual field time will be September to December of each year. The first wave in the first subsample of the SOEP-IS started in September 2011, with a newly developed core questionnaire ""SOEP Innovations"" and new methods to measure gender stereotypes.

The overall volume and costs of the surveys to be conducted in the SOEP-IS will be lower than if ""fresh"" samples were used: central household and individual characteristics, invariant over time, are already available and will not have to be collected again.

A 2-Step-Module of Governance will be established to regulate topics and question modules: first, the SOEP survey management runs a basic methodological test to establish whether the size, format and survey mode outlined in a proposal seem appropriate for implementation in the SOEP-IS. The SOEP Survey Committee will then check the content of proposals received and prioritize these for selection purposes. 

Information about SOEP-IS in general and about the application process is published in David Richter & Jürgen Schupp (2012). SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) - Description, Structure and Documentation. SOEPpaper 463.
