## Study info

The SOEP group at DIW Berlin introduced the SOEP-IS panel for short-term experiments but also for long-term surveys that are not possible in the core SOEP—for instance, because they require instruments that are not yet well established or that deal with very specific research topics. In addition to Samples E and I from the core SOEP, which were started in 1998 and 2009, respectively, new samples were drawn in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 to achieve the final number of 5,000 respondents. The annual interviews since 2011 have contained not only questions from the core SOEP but also innovative modules, which are selected in a peer-reviewed competition as of the 2013 survey year to identify the “best” research questions. Some of the many topics include earnings, employment, education, health and more.

## Method

All samples of SOEP-IS are multi-stage random samples with regional clustering. In the past, households were selected by random-walk (since 2023: register-based sampling).
Until 2020, data collection was exclusively conducted via CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing). No data was collected in 2021. In 2022, infas shifted data collection to CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) and CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) with CAPI only available by request or if the telephone number was missing. Generally, all household members of age 18 and older within a sampled household are asked to participate in the surveys. In addition, one household member (head of household / anchor person) is asked to complete a household questionnaire covering information on living conditions, housing costs, and different sources of income. This questionnaire also includes some questions about children in the household up to age 16 (until 2022) or 18 (since 2023), for example, their kindergarten or school attendance.

## Data access

To ensure the confidentiality of respondents’ information, the SOEP adheres to strict security standards in the provision of SOEP-IS data. The data are reserved exclusively for research use, that is, they are provided only to the scientific community. For individuals and institutions that already have a valid SOEP data distribution contract, an informal application can be submitted to the SOEP in the form of a letter or e-mail requesting a supplemental contract allowing expanded use of the SOEP data.
After users have signed or updated their data distribution contract with DIW Berlin, they will receive the SOEP-IS dataset by personalized encrypted download. At the SOEP Data Research Center, users can also access small-scale regional data that can be linked to the SOEP-IS data.
Additional information and all the required forms can be found on the SOEP webpage.

The datasets are available for Stata and SPSS in versions with German and English labels.
