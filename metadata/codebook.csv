soep-is,bioage,2015,Introduction,"The bioage data file is generated using information collected in the “Mother & Child” and “Parent” questionnaires. It contains information on every child, on which at least one questionnaire has been answered by one of the parents. Each row can be identified by the ID of the child (pid), the survey year (syear) and the ID of the respondent (pidresp), which means that sometimes there are more than one row per child and year.

There are five different “Mother & Child” and “Parent” questionnaires in the SOEP and three different “Mother & Child” questionnaires in the SOEP-IS. The information from all eight questionnaires is included the bioage data set. The bioage data set contains all variables with information on the children surveyed in SOEP-IS available within the SOEP-IS and the core SOEP—regardless of whether these variables are also surveyed in the SOEP-IS or only in the core SOEP. The “Mother & Child” and “Parent” questionnaires aim to follow and observe future generations of the SOEP-IS and collect all information in one file, even though the data come from different survey years. As we try to make this process as comprehensive and gap-free as possible, we begin following and documenting the development of children in SOEP-IS households from birth onwards.",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,bioage,2015,Data Files and Respondents,"The data file bioage contains a variable named bioage identifying the bioage questionnaire the data stems from. The specific suffix reflects the age of the children in it (e.g., bioage06 includes children who turned six that survey year, producing a range in ages between 5 years and 1 month and 6 years and 11 months, depending on the birth month and interview month). Except for bioage08a and bioage08b, it is usually the mother who completes the questionnaire. In the exceptional case that a mother cannot complete the questionnaire, the father does. Both the father’s and the mother’s personal ID numbers have the suffix resp (pidresp). Note that while the parents are the actual respondents, the data are organized under the child’s unchanging personal ID number (pid).

Bioage01 (SOEP): “Mother and Child” Questionnaire, Children Aged 0-1 years

The questionnaire is given to all women in the core SOEP who gave birth to a child in the current or previous survey year and to all women whose non-biological child was born in the same period. The questionnaire contains information on pregnancy, childbirth, childcare, and child health. In the exceptional case that a mother is unable to complete the questionnaire, the father responds.

Bioage03 (SOEP): “Your child between the ages of two and three”, Children Aged 2-3 years

The questionnaire is given to all mothers in the core SOEP whose child turns three in the current survey year. In the exceptional case that a mother cannot complete the questionnaire, the father responds.

Bioage06 (SOEP): “Your child between the ages of five and six”, Children Aged 5-6 years

The questionnaire is given to all mothers in the core SOEP whose child turns six in the current survey year. In the exceptional case that a mother cannot complete the questionnaire, the father responds.

Bioage08a and Bioage08b (SOEP): “Parent” Questionnaire, children aged 7-8 years

The questionnaire is given to both mothers and fathers of children turning eight in the current survey year of the core SOEP. Data of parent 1, which is usually the mother, can be found in bioage08a. Data of parent 2, which is usually the father, can be found in bioage08b.

Bioage 0-23 months (SOEP-IS): “Mother and Child” Questionnaire, Children Aged 0-2 years

The questionnaire is given to all mothers in the SOEP-IS whose child is under two years old. In the exceptional case that a mother cannot complete the questionnaire, the father responds.

Bioage 24-47 months (SOEP-IS): “Mother and Child” Questionnaire, Children Aged 3-4 years

The questionnaire is given to all mothers in the SOEP-IS whose child is between two and four years old. In the exceptional case that a mother cannot complete the questionnaire, the father responds.

Bioage >48 months (SOEP-IS): “Parent” Questionnaire, Children Aged 5-16 years

The questionnaire is given to either mothers or fathers in the SOEP-IS whose child is older than four but younger than 16 years. We ask the person who knows the child best, in most cases the mother, to complete the questionnaire.",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,bioage,2015,Topics and Variables,"The bioage data sets contain information regarding

• Pregnancy and childbirth

• Child health

• Childcare situation

• Changes in living circumstances since birth of child

• Child’s abilities

• Parenting experiences

• Expectations about the child’s success in school

• Educational goals and aspirations of the parents

• Educational behavior of the parents

• Self-conception of the role of parents

The rules used to generate the variables from the questionnaires are consistent over the various bioage questionnaires. This ensures consistency over the years, even if different questionnaires (in terms of question order or content) are used. The consistency also makes it possible to compare different age groups easily as the data is presented in “long” format, i.e., the datasets contain information from SOEP’s bioage01, bioage03, bioage06, bioage08a and bioage08b as well as SOEP-IS’s bioage 0-23 months, bioage 24-47 months, and bioage >48 months.",,,,,,,,,

soep-is,biobirth,2015,Population and purpose of the data set BIOBIRTH,"The file BIOBIRTH covers the following information:

(1) sum, year of birth and sex of the biological children of a male/female respondent up to the last date of interview

(2) Person identifier (KIDPNR[n]) of the children (provided the child can be identified) which corresponds to variable PID in file PPFAD.

BIOBIRTH is based on every male/female respondent who has ever had at least one successful SOEP or IS interview. For each of these respondents, the data set BIOBIRTH documents the birth biography with one row per respondent in the dataset. The annual update focuses on including information on new births collected in the individual questionnaire or in the biographical questionnaire. Furthermore respondents who have been interviewed for the first time but who gave no information on births yet are included. The latter are either new household members or teenagers who have reached the required minimum for a SOEP-IS participation (16 years). For that reason BIOBIRTH can be described as an accumulative data set, in which the entire birth biography of all SOEP-IS respondents is presented. 
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Structure of the data set,"BIOBIRTH contains the following variables for all male/female respondents:

• CID  Invariable number of the original household

• PID  Invariable personal number of the male/female respondent

• BIOVALID Status of the birth biography:

10:  no birth biographical entries.

20:  youth biography questionnaire completed, no children in biography.

30: birth biography questionnaire completed, no children in biography.

31: birth biography questionnaire completed, one or more children in biography.

• BIOYEAR Year of the survey of the birth biography, respectively “-2” for respondents without information stemming from this special survey    instrument.

• BIOAGE Age of the respondent at the time of the birth biography survey. If no birth biographical information is available yet, the age at the very first survey is indicated.

• SUMKIDS Total number of children born (more precisely: total number of children identifiable within SOEP-IS by merging all available data up to the time of the last observation).

• BIOKIDS Total number of children identified through the birth biography. For respondents who haven’t filled in the birth biographical questionnaire yet, the code “-2” applies.

• KIDGEB[n] Year of birth of the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

• KIDSEX[n] Sex of the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

• KIDPNR[n] Personal number of the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child), in so far as it is identifiable in the SOEP-IS.

• KIDMON[n] Month of birth of a child (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

For the variables KIDGEB[n], KIDSEX[n], KIDPNR[n], and KIDMON[n] identical missing codes apply: The code “-2“ is assigned if there’s no [n]th child found for this male/female parent. The code “-1” applies if information about the [n]th child is found but information about the year of birth or the sex is missing or the child could not be identified by a personal identifier (“pid”) within the SOEP-IS.

For every male/female respondent, a maximum of 15 entries for children is provided, although the biography questionnaire enables only ten possible entries regarding birth information. If there have been additional births up to the time the biography questionnaire is collected, they are recorded separately by the interviewer and are included in BIOBIRTH. The sequence of children within BIOBIRTH is recorded with regards to the age of the children. The oldest child is recorded under KIDPNR01 the second oldest under KIDPNR02 and so on. If the age is missing the lowest personal identifier applies.
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Information basis of the birth biography,"The main basis of the individual birth biography in BIOBIRTH is normally the information collected by the biography questionnaire, in which the number, year of birth and sex of the biological children for every male/female respondent are collected. For respondents with information on children stemming from the biography questionnaire the BIOVALID code “31” is assigned. Respondents who completed this questionnaire but did not report on any births receive the code “30”. In addition, the variable BIOAGE contains the age at the time of the collection of the life history. Apart from this one-time collection within the scope of the first SOEP interview, there is no other possibility in SOEP to collect information on the number, the residence status, or if appropriate, the year of death of children who were born before the first SOEP-IS interview.

A minority of male/female respondents have no information from the biographical questionnaire due to several reasons. In this cases the variable BIOVALID has the code “10” and the variable BIOAGE contains the age at the first time of SOEP-IS interview. The group can be divided into different sub-populations and is in principle affected by the risk of underestimating the total number of births:

• Respondents who were at the time of the first interview only 16 years old. In most cases these respondents participate at a later date in the biography survey. Thus, the parent-child relationship recorded earlier in BIOBIRTH can be checked later with the birth biography.

• Respondents who are 30 years old or younger at the first interview. In this sub-population, children are not yet adults and live in most cases in the parents’ household. Since information from the biographical questionnaire is missing, a final distinction in social and biological children is not possible.

• Respondents who are over 30 years old at the time of the first interview. Some of the children don’t live any more in the parents’ household at the time of the first interview and therefore they are not part of the survey population. For that reason the number of biological children might be underestimated in this group of respondents (over 30 years) to a larger extent compared to younger respondents.
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,A source of biographical information (waves O to BB) - the youth questionnaire,"The youth questionnaire is handed out in the waves O to BB, whereas SOEP-IS does not provide this questionnaire. With regard to wave O to BB, 74 female and 71 male respondents  filled out the youth questionnaire. In view of the relatively small number of cases in SOEP-IS, further information are provided in BIOBIRTH documentation of the SOEP.
Nevertheless, a few changes to the BIOBIRTH data-set have to be outlined:

• In the variable BIOVALID a new code (“20”: “youth biography questionnaire completed”) is added. As the youth questionnaire doesn’t contain any information about own children the addendum “no children in biography” is always added to the code “20”.

• While calculating the age at the time of the biographical questionnaire (BIOAGE), the age upon completion of the youth questionnaire is applied.

• The variable BIOKIDS always remains at zero as no biographical information on parenthood can be derived from the youth-biography (in this cases no missing code is applied in BIOKIDS).
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Identification process of the children in the SOEP data base,"The starting point for the process of identifying children is the relationship of a household member to the head of the household (HH) (variable STELL in the file PBRUTTO).
There are only certain combinations among household members in which a biological parent-child relationship among an adult and another person can be assumed.

For the remaining unassigned children within a household a thorough check is performed to scan for parent-child ties that can be derived from more complex household relationships. It should be noted here that the larger the number of persons living in a household, the more complicated the relationships become among the individual household members. For that reason only the combination of the information from the biography questionnaire with the information from PBRUTTO (and in most cases the mother indicator K_PMUM provides the most reliable definition of a biological mother-child relationship.
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Identification of the children for male/female respondents with biographical data,"If a respondent mentioned the birth, the sex and of year of birth of a child in the biography questionnaire, the identification process has been started. In the first step, the program identified the respondents’s relationship to the reference person and looked on the basis of the parent-child combination - as illustrated above- for a potential child in the household. If the year of birth and the sex of this person are the same as named in the life history interview of the assumed parent, the person has been identified as the child of this parent. Since the majority of the households with children present small nuclear families including one potential mother and/or father, this kind of identification process was completely sufficient. In other, rather complex households a careful hand editing has been examined, in order to identify the ‘right’ child to the ‘right’ mother and/or father. The same has been done, if the sex or the important information – the year of birth - of a child mentioned in the biography questionnaire of a respondent was missing.

In the case of a successful identification the variable KIDPNR[n] has been filled with the person identifier of this child. Children, for whom the respondent in the biography questionnaire has reported that they were deceased or had moved out, were assigned the personal number (KIDPNR[n]) “-1”, for missing information, in BIOBIRTH.
",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Identificaton of the children for male/female respondents who have no biography data/ not completed the biography questionnaire,"To get as close as possible to the definition of a biological child, specific relationships among household members were allowed. Since the main important information – from the biography questionnaire - is missing, a careful analysis of the composition and the history of the household in which the children live has been examined, in order to assign the ‘right’ child to the ‘right’ mother and/or father.",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Last step of the identification process,"If a child is identified through the above described process and it was not yet old enough to be surveyed itself (under 16 years old) and lived at least in a partially realized household, an additional source of information is made available along with the data set KID to check the relationship. For each person in this group (under 16 years old), there is an indicator for the mother ($K_PMUM) containing the person identifier of the mother. Although this information does not necessarily indicate a biological mother-child relationship, at least the identification process for a large portion of the women could be checked or compared.",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobirth,2015,Updating biobirth,"The annual update of the data set BIOBIRTH is examined with respect to two dimensions. First, updating the birth biography of the BIOBIRTH population and second, extending BIOBIRTH by new persons. The latter are either new household members or teenagers who have reached the required age for giving a first interview (16 years). Since the extension of BIOBIRTH follows the generation rules as described above, the following only summarizes the updating of the birth biography of the BIOBIRTH population.

New born children in the SOEP study are documented in the variable PZUG in the data set PBRUTTO:

Code  Label

11  Born since the last survey

17  Born before the last survey, but only now first mentioned

31  Born two years ago

For this group of new born persons the identification process starts this time in the reverse direction: While we have looked before for the children, now we are looking for the parents.
Since new born children by definition could not be a reference person or a partner of the reference person, several STELL codes are excluded. Further combinations are excluded, in which the basis of a parent-child relationship could not have been identified with sufficient significance. Again, the majority of the households with children, in particular with small children, are nuclear households or lone parent households. For that reason this kind of identification process often yields in a successful identification of the new born children. With regard to IS, all newborn children are biological children of the household head and sorted to household head or partner / spouse of the household head. Nevertheless, the mother indicator information from KID was again drawn upon as a check.

soep-is,biobrthm,2013,Contents of the BIOBRTHM data-set,"The data-set BIOBRTHM – the birth biography of male respondents – contains the same set of variables as the initial BIOBIRTH file – the birth biography of female respondents. Refer to the documentation of the latter file for basic information, concerning the SOEP birth biography.
The variables are:

• CID  Invariable number of the original household.

• PID Invariable personal number of the man.

• BIOVALID Status of the birth biography:

10: no birth biographical entries.

 20: youth biography questionnaire completed, no children in biography.

30: birth biography questionnaire completed, no children in biography.

31: birth biography questionnaire completed, one or more children in biography.

• BIOYEAR Year of the birth biography survey, respectively “-2” for men without information stemming from this special survey instrument.

• BIOAGE Age of the man at the time of the birth biography survey. If no birth biographical information is available yet, the age at the very first survey is indicated.

• SUMKIDS Total number of children born (more precisely: total number of children identifiable within SOEP-IS by merging all available data up to the time of the last observation (SUMKIDS=BIOKIDS+NEWKIDS).

• BIOKIDS Total number of children identified through the birth biography. For men who haven’t filled in the birth biographical questionnaire yet, the code “-2” applies.

• NEWKIDS Total number of children identified through PBRUTTO or KID.

• KIDGEB[n] Children's year of birth (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

• KIDSEX[n] Sex of the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

• KIDPNR[n] Personal number of the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child), as far as this person is identifiable in the SOEP.

• KIDMON[n] Month of birth for the children (for the first child up to the fifteenth child).

For the variables KIDGEB[n], KIDSEX[n], KIDPNR[n], and KIDMON[n] identical missing codes apply: The code “-2“ is assigned if there’s no [n]th child found for this mother. The code “-1” applies if information about the [n]th child is found, but information about the year of birth or the sex is missing or the child could not be identified by a personal identifier (“pid”) within the SOEP.
For a complete overview of contents and construction of variables refer to the document “BIOBIRTH – A Data Set on the Birth Biography of Female Respondents”",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobrthm,2013,Population of BIOBRTHM,"Like the female birth-biography, the population of BIOBRTHM consists of all respondents of the relevant sex (here, all male respondents) with at least one personal interview up to the current wave. With regard to sample I, no biographical questionnaires are handed out in 2009. Therefore, the questionnaires are completed one wave after the starting wave in 2010. For all the men who do not fill out the biographical questionnaire, the information about fatherhood is underestimated as only the context of the household can be taken into account when considering the number of children (see the documentation of the file BIOBIRTH, 3 for the reasons of this underestimation and further details). Furthermore, this underestimation is more severe for men who did not complete the biographical questionnaire than it is for women as children remain more often with the mother than with the father after the split of a relationship.",,,,,,,,,
soep-is,biobrthm,2013,Construction of variables - Particularities,"The construction of variables for the data-set BIOBIRTHM mostly resembles the generation of variables within the BIOBIRTH file. The major difference affects information from the data-set KID from which the mother-child-pointer is used when generating the birth-biography of women to link the right child to a given mother. For men such a pointer is not available. Therefore, the focus of variable construction remains on utilizing information from PBRUTTO where the household context is taken into account. For details of BIOBRTHM variable construction based on PBRUTTO please refer to the documentation of the file BIOBIRTH as the construction remains – besides the mentioned differences – identical.",,,,,,,,,

Possible underestimation in “screener” can thus be assessed and corrected. However, in the case of item-nonresponse on the original screener, the procedure is only used for households surveyed completely, without item-non-response on the variables in question.

For personal income, we use monthly net income (from dependent employment and self-employment), extra earnings, pensions, widow’s pensions, unemployment benefits or relief, maintenance payments, early retirement payments, maternity benefits, BaFoeG (state higher education grants), military or civil service pay, compulsory child support, as well as other forms of support from the P files.
Civil servants’ pensions income is taxed at the flat rate of 20% and multiple entries on the use of employment office services are corrected for by calculating a median value.
We add all the individual incomes of all interviewed household members, also adding to this sum all income from the household context (housing subsidies, child benefits, welfare and home nursing subsidies, social assistance; since 2005 also Unemployment Benefit II (“ALG II”) or Social Benefit).

When no answer was provided on net household income, we use the net household income calculated as described above, under the condition that all household members gave valid answers.
If the net household income generated in this way is higher than the household income stated in the questionnaire, we correct the value upwards. When no answer was given for the different components of income, we set the value of the particular component at zero.
HGAHINC was not generated from 2011 on.

soep-is,hgen,2015,Variables in file hgen,,,,hgnuts1,,,"NUTS (""Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units"") is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the European Union. It was introduced by Eurostat more than 30 years ago in order to provide a single uniform breakdown of territorial units for the production of regional statistics. NUTS 1 especially contains the major socio-economic regions for analyzing regional Community problems. It subdivides the European Union by now into 97 regions, whereas in Germany there are equivalent to the German Federal States 16 regions.",,,
soep-is,hgen,2015,Imputation of Household Income,"**Procedure**

Multiple imputation procedures provide a way to deal with missing values on the variable HGHINC current monthly net household income in Euros by using information about determinants of the household income and replacing item-nonresponse with multiply imputed data. Five imputations are available within the $HGEN datasets: the variables hgi1hinc-hgi5hinc. 
The imputations were calculated using the method of chained equations predictive mean matching in STATA. The procedures were written by Patrick Royston (see Royston 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2007, 2009) and Ian White (see White, Daniel and Royston 2010; White, Royston and Wood 2011).
Predicted mean matching means that for each missing observation on income, the particular non-missing observation is found whose prediction on observed data is closest. This closest observation is used to impute the missing value. The most important variable for modelling the current monthly net household income is monthly net household income of the previous year. A complete list of the variables used for modelling is available upon request.

The missing observations were assumed to be missing at random. We set the number of imputations m=5 and get 5 multiple imputed values for HGHINC. The number of iterations carried out in each prediction model was specified to be 2000. Samples E&I&S1 and the supplementary sample S2 were imputed separately in 2014. 


**Analysing multiple imputed data**

For analysing multiple imputed data, you do not necessarily need special methods, however such tools exist and simplify the use of multiply imputed data. Below a short overview of some useful tools for various statistical packages is given. These tools estimate the parameters of a regression model by combining the estimates across the several replicates of imputation. Point estimates from multiple imputations are then the arithmetic mean of the several point estimates obtained from analysis on each imputed data. Standard errors are obtained by combining the average of the squared standard errors of the several (m) estimates with the within-and between-imputation variance.
STATA provides a builtin functionality called mi.
Within SAS, PROC MIANALYZE combines the results of analyses on the data sets. 
IVEware is a set of routines that can be launched from SAS or run independently using data from many sources. You can use the IVEware module regress to perform multiple imputation analysis.

soep-is,irisk,2015,Overview,"Decisions from description and decisions from experience. The choice task in the description paradigm consists of two monetary gambles with explicitly stated outcomes and probabilities. In turn, the decisions from experience paradigm consists of an initial sampling stage in which a person explores two payoff distributions without costs by clicking on one of the two buttons on the computer screen, followed by an outcome drawn from the respective distribution. After terminating sampling, the person sees a choice screen and is asked to select the button to draw once for real.

We used a within-subject design in which individuals were asked to choose between monetary gambles in two blocks of trials, one involving decisions from description, and another, decisions from experience, with the presentation order being counterbalanced across participants. Participants were asked to perform 4 choices within each block. Set size was manipulated to test for information overload effects because previous work suggests that more cognitively demanding tasks lead to significant individual and age differences in risk taking (two vs. four options; cf. Frey, Mata, & Hertwig, 2013; Hills Noguchi, & Gibbert, 2013; Mata et al., 2011). In sum, the design will be 2 (format: description vs. experience) x 2 (set size: two vs. four options). ",,,,,,,,,

soep-is,pgen,2015,Variables in file pgen,,,,pgpartz,,,"Partner indentifier have the purpose of clearly defining spouse (married) and partner (unmarried) relationships in SOEP-IS households and thus enabling analyses on the couple level. The variable PGPARTZ generated in this context reveals whether a person in a SOEP-IS household has a partner in that household, and if so, the type of relationship existing between the partners. Relationships with persons outside the SOEP household are not covered by this variable.

To explain the codes:

Code 0 is automatically assigned to all persons living in households in which there is clearly no partnership. These include:

(a) one-person households

(b) single-parent households

(c) household head living together with only one parent (or parent-in-law)

Codes 1 to 4 define these relationships. To assign Codes 1 and 2, the partnership has to be clearly definable from the perspective of both partners. This implies agreement between the codes of the variable STELL (= relationship to head of household in PBRUTTO) pointing to a possible partnership (e.g., the combination 0 (=head of household) and 1 (=spouse of household head)), as well as agreement between the codes for family status in that wave (e.g., married couples both have the Code 1 (=married, living together)). In case of ambiguity, the marital history is taken into account as well. If there are inconsistencies between the answers provided by the two persons, or between data on marital status and relationship to head of household, each person is examined individually within his or her household context. If uncertainty remains, the codes 3 or 4 are assigned.",,,

soep-is,pgen,2015,Variables in file pgen,,,,pgerwzt,,,"The variable PGERWZT is designed to offer data on the length of time with the firm at the point in time of the interview for all employed persons. This variable is generated from the respondent’s start date with the current employer. In the case of a job change within the firm, the full length of time with the firm is calculated. Hence, the variable describes the length of time with the same firm and not the length of time in the same position.

The variable provides consistent longitudinal information on the length of time with the same employer. Data that show longitudinal inconsistencies are corrected.

1. In case of no job change, the information on the start date with the current employer given in the earliest interview available is treated as dominant and carried forward to the subsequent years.

2. In case of a job change between firms, the information on the start of the current position is used and carried forward to the subsequent years.

3. Up to wave Z (2009), a respondent who starts working again after a period of non-employment is assumed to have returned to the former employer if the indicated start date with the current employer was before the previous interview date. In this case, the start date with the current employer given in the previous interview is treated as dominant. Otherwise, the present information on the start date with the current employer is used and carried forward to the subsequent years.
For respondents who are assumed to have returned to their former employer, the full length of time with the firm is calculated. There is no deduction for the time during which the respondent was not employed.
 
4. Since wave BA (2010), there is a modified answer category in the questionnaire which indicates that a respondent returns to his/her former employer after a period of non-employment. If a respondent indicates to have started working again at a former employer, the present information on the start date with the current employer is used and carried forward to the subsequent years. Unlike before wave BA (2010), the present information is treated as dominant even if the indicated start date with the current employer was before the previous interview date. Hence, the full length of time with the firm is calculated, and there is no deduction for the time during which the respondent was not employed or employed in another firm.
 
5. The length of time with the firm is also provided for the East German sample since its start in 1990. Due to the massive restructuring of the economy that took place in East Germany after reunification, this variable should be dealt with cautiously in the first transition years.

Both monthly and annual information is used in the variables and rounded off as length of time in years (with months in decimal form). If the month was not available a random month is used.

Since the beginning of the SOEP in the year 1984, the number of values assigned has been based on a large number of highly differentiated answer categories. It is designed to provide consistent longitudinal data on labor force participation across all waves.

 PGLFS provides a differentiation between “working” (Code 11-12) and “non-working” (Code 1-10), categories which are constant over all waves. Non-employment is subdivided further in order to make it possible to efficiently apply different labor market concepts in studying the data. To calculate this variable, the variables on employment status, age, maternity leave, second jobs, registration at the employment office, participation in paid work during the past 7 days and training status are used. Code (12) was added in 2000.

For respondents who have multiple status codes and different values for this variable, the following hierarchy was used to determine which of the values would play the determining role (increasing dominance):   

                11 - working   

                 1 - non-working without further information

This variable is designed to provide annual data on occupational activity for all employed persons according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations ISCO-88. Respondents answer the question on their current occupational title in their own words, and this response is entered into a blank in the questionnaire.

ISCO-88 is a strictly four-digit classification, and this variable is therefore coded in four-digit form. In contrast to the previous version of the classification system, ISCO-68, ISCO-88 does not use blanks if there is no adequate information for specific coding, but uses zeros instead. Thus 4000 stands for an unspecified office job; 2300 stands for teachers and 2000 stands for scientists, both without closer specification. There is no conversion key since the two classifications differ significantly.  

Not all employed persons are asked the relevant input questions on an annual basis. Only those employed persons who changed jobs and first-time respondents were asked to provide up-to-date information.

PGEGP is derived from the Standard International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI). Technically, the variable was created by scaling the ISCO-88 classification. In addition, it is based on information about income, education and occupation. The EGP Index was documented by Ganzeboom/Treiman in 1996 and revised in 2003.

 The values for the variable range between 1 and 11; additional categories are (15) not working – registered unemployed and (18) not working – pensioner.

Non-working persons are only assigned to the category “not working – pensioner” if they are recipients of retirement pension or if they are recipients of widow’s pension AND are older than 60 years. Moreover, if there is missing information on pension receipt, additional information from ARTKALEN (retrospective information from the activity calendar for the previous year) is used in the generation process to determine if a person was in retirement or early retirement (Vorruhestand) at the time of the interview. Hence, the category “not working – pensioner” in the most recent wave will be updated with retrospective information of the following wave. All other non-working persons are assigned to category (-2) “does not apply” as long as they are not registered as unemployed (category 15).

Annual information on the occupational position is used to generate the EGP-categories for the self-employed. In case no information on the number of employees is available, the PGEGP-categories (5) and (6) contain information on the firm size for self-employed persons.
 
Based on the new classification developed by Ganzeboom/Treiman (2003), several ISCO values were recoded in PGEGP as follows:

- ISCO 2470 becomes EGP=1.

- ISCO 2500 becomes EGP=2.

soep-is,pgen,2015,Variables in file pgen,,,,pgautono,,,"This variable gives the occupational autonomy for all employed persons. It offers an alternative to the ISCO-based scales on occupational status (PGISEI), class (PGEGP), or prestige (PGSIOPS). PGAUTONO is the simplest variable based on the scales of “occupational position” in terms of its construction, and strongly correlated with the Treiman Prestige Scale (PGSIOPS).

The basis for the “autonomy in occupational activity” scale is the classification of occupational position. Self-employed persons are categorized according to the size of the company (with the exception of farmers, who are all classified within the same category of autonomy, independent of farm size in hectares). Civil servants are differentiated according to the civil service laws defining each kind of activity and the amount of autonomy connected to it. Workers are differentiated according to their vocational training, and thus categorized hierarchically according to the different tasks they can be expected to carry out and the different amounts of responsibility associated with each task. Similarly, salaried employees are classified according to how differentiated their tasks are and how much responsibility is associated with each.

The value “1” is assigned mainly to manual workers with a low level of status and a low level of autonomy. Group 2 encompasses work in production, services demanding a minimal level of specialization, and farm work. Activities that require completion of the middle track of secondary education and entail a limited amount of responsibility are classified in Group 3. Group 4 includes activities carried out either with or without supervision that require a degree from a college of applied sciences or university, but are not very high in prestige. Managers and freelance academics are both placed in Group 5 (highest autonomy). Depending on the number of employees, self-employed are categorized in Group 3, Group 4, or Group 5.

It creates the highest degree/diploma attained, taking into account degrees and diplomas attained in both general schooling and in vocational and university education. Here the higher-level vocational and university override lower-level school diplomas. Persons who, for example, have no values for the variables on secondary school degrees/diplomas but state that they have a university degree are placed in the highest ISCED category.
 Please note that, due to a lack of more detailed information on tertiary degrees -- in particular on doctoral degrees -- we include all tertiary degrees in our ISCED category 6. Thus, the ISCED variable provided here is not comparable one-to-one with the ISCED levels as defined by the OECD, since we have included the original ISCED level 5A in our ISCED category 6.

The imputations were calculated using the method of chained equations predictive mean matching in STATA.

Predicted mean matching means that for each missing observation on income, the particular non-missing observation is found whose prediction on observed data is closest. This closest observation is used to impute the missing value. The most important variable for modelling the current net labor income is the gross labor income of the previous year. A complete list of the variables used for modelling is available upon request.
The missing observations were assumed to be missing at random. We set the number of imputations m=5 and get 5 multiple imputed values for pglabnet.

PGJOBCH is generated based on the central filter variable, which indicates whether a respondent has changed jobs since the beginning of the previous year. Information on the date of job change is then combined with interview month of the previous year’s interview to identify whether a new job change has taken place since the previous interview.  

Hence, PGJOBCH is a modified version of the variable PGERWTYP which indicates whether a respondent has changed jobs since the beginning of the previous year. Unlike PGERWTYP, the variable is calculated for all waves, and the codes are assigned independently of the respondent being a first-time or follow-up respondent.

In addition to PGERWTYP, the variable is also designed to identify respondents who have entered employment for the first time.

In addition to PGERWTYP, the variable is designed to provide consistent longitudinal information on job changes. The PGJOBCH variable is generated by correcting the original job change information in various ways:

1. We check whether the job changes stated by a respondent in two consecutives interviews refer to one and the same job change. The date of the job change and the interview month are used to correct double entries.
 
2. If the respondent indicates a job change with a date before the previous interview but did not state a job change in the previous interview, this is coded as a job change in the current interview.

3. If a respondent indicates no job change and was not employed at the time of the previous interview, this is coded as ""no job change"" despite the seeming implausibility, since there are possible explanations how this information could be plausible, e.g. if there were short-term employment spells between two interview dates.
 
4. Respondents can be ""first-time employed"" only once. If a respondent states being ""first-time employed"" for a second time, this is coded as ""employed, with change"".

Biography questionnaire: Since 2001 similar information is collected from respondents who fill in the biography questionnaire (usually during the first two years of participation in the panel). In contrast to the information from the person questionnaire the questions do not refer to currently obtained degrees but to degrees obtained during the time before being part of the SOEP sample.

In the variable PGFIELD we combine these two types of information. Each year the variable contains the most recently collected information.

If you want to take into account that a person holds two degrees you have to combine the information from all available years. However, only a minority of the population holds more than one tertiary degree. In very few cases we encounter the problem that a respondent provides information on two different degrees in one survey year. This only happens in years when respondents fill in the person as well as the biography questionnaire. In these cases we prioritize the information from the person questionnaire as it refers to the current situation while the biography questionnaire contains retrospective information. Furthermore, there are cases who report an applied university degree and a university degree in the biography questionnaire. In these cases, the variable contains information on the university degree only.

The variable is coded according to the classification on fields of education (“Fächergruppen”) provided by the Statistisches Bundesamt (2009). Until 2009 data from the person questionnaire were coded using an earlier version of this classification (1982). In the variable PGFIELD we recoded the original values. As the newer version is more precise this could be done with hardly any loss of information. Some categories are collapsed. Category 3 is coded as 2 (no distinction between catholic and protestant theology), 14 as 13, 17 as 16, 24 as 23, 25 as 26 and 48 as 49.

Because detailed information on the field of tertiary education is not assessed in the Questionnaire of the SOEP Innovation Sample, PGFIELD is not generated for Sample E (since 2012), I (since 2011) and the supplementary samples (since 2012). For this purpose, PGFIELD is coded to ""-5"" (not contained in questionnaire).","Stat. Bundesamt (2009): Bildung und Kultur.

While the latter variable records if a person holds a degree PGDEGREE contains more detailed information on the type of the degree. The data of the generated variable PGDEGREE stem from two sources: 1. Person questionnaire: Each year since 1985 respondents are asked if they have left education since the beginning of the year prior to the survey and which degrees they have obtained. This part of the questionnaire contains an open question on the type and the field of newly obtained tertiary degrees. This information is coded and used for the generation of the variables PGDEGREE. 2.

In contrast to the information from the person questionnaire the questions do not refer to currently obtained degrees but to degrees obtained during the time before being part of the SOEP sample.

In the variable PGDEGREE we combine these two types of information. However, since the retrospective information was not collected before 2001 the variable covers until 2000 only persons for whom we have prospectively observed the end of study. This explains why the number of valid observations is rather small in these years.

The variable is coded according to a slightly collapsed version of the classification on types of tertiary degrees (“Prüfungsgruppen und Abschlussprüfungen”) provided by the Statistisches Bundesamt (2009). Since 2010 the data were coded according to the classification presented here. In the variable PGDEGREE we recoded the original values from years 2009 and earlier. As the newer version is more precise this could be done with hardly any loss of information. Some categories are collapsed. Category 16 was mostly likely coded as 15 in earlier years, 34 as 35 and 43 as 44. The original values of the data collected from the person questionnaire of 2009 are stored in the respective variables in the dataset P.

In addition to the variable PGTRAINA we provide the variables PGTRAINB, PGTRAINC and PGTRAIND. All these variables record the occupation of vocational training. The difference is that PGTRAINA contains information on vocational training within the German dual system which combines firm-based and school-based training (apprenticeship). PGTRAINB is designed to provide information on the occupation of full-time school based vocational training. PGTRAINC contains information on level vocational training (e.g., Meister, Techniker). PGTRAIND is designed to provide information on the occupation of civil servant training (“Beamtenausbildung”). We describe in brief detail the construction of the variable PGTRAINA. PGTRAINB, PGTRAINC and PGTRAIND are constructed in an analogous manner.

soep-is,ppfad,2015,General Information,"This file is designed to support longitudinal analysis linking personal information from various waves of SOEP-IS. Each person saved in at least one $PBRUTTO file is also in PPFAD. The only sorting
key (SORT-ID) is the unchanging person identification number PID. The variable CID contains the unchanging original household number whereas the variables HID$$ contain the current household number of the particular household in which the person lived and was interviewed at the time of the survey, either as an adult household member or child. The variables NETTO$$ give the wave-specific interview status or tell which file contains a person in a particular wave ($P, $KIND, etc.) or whether the person has left SOEP-IS.

The variables $HID and $NETTO are coded “–2” for those waves in which a person is not yet or no longer part of the SOEP survey population. In addition, PPFAD contains basic demographic variables, which have been longitudinally tested to some extent:

o SEX (sex)

o GEBJAHR (4-digit birth year)

o TODJAHR (4-digit year of death, if applicable)

o IMMIYEAR (year of first immigration to Germany)

o GERMBORN (born in Germany)

o CORIGIN  (country of origin)

o MIGBACK (migration background)

o MIGINFO (information source for MIGBACK)

It is recommended that these tested variables are used for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. These variables are adjusted on a wave-by-wave basis in the framework of demographic testing. Therefore, a small number of individuals from different original SOEP-IS households moved into the same household. These individuals share the same current household number for the current wave (HID) but have different original household numbers, CID. With the variable $CASEMAT, these households are assigned the value of the CASE-ID (CID) that also needs to be taken into account. All other households are assigned the value -2.

Further methodological variables (year, four-digit):

o EINTRITT: year a person joined SOEP-IS

o AUSTRITT: year a person ultimately left SOEP-IS

o ERSTBEFR: year of a person’s first interview

o LETZTBEF: year of a person’s most recent interview",,,,,,,,,

It considers the nationality of the individual, his/her migration history as well as that of his/her parents. In order to do so information on country of birth, citizenship and its change over time (in case of naturalization for example), and if available, parental information (direct information or proxy information) are combined.
Direct/Indirect migration background indicates whether the person immigrated by him/herself (direct migration background) or if she/he is of migrant origin but born in Germany (indirect migration background). That applies for children with parents who have an indirect migration background. Respondents assigned the code 4 have a migration background. As the information on the region of birth is missing, it is not possible to know whether they migrated by themselves of if they were born in Germany.

Note that code '[1] No Migration Background' also includes persons of German nationality born in Germany whose parental information are not available. Some of them might be migrants’ offspring. Thus, the MIGBACK variable slightly underestimates the number of persons belonging to code '[3] Indirect Migration Background'.

Note that in principle, an individual who gains a foreign nationality will be classified as being of migrant origin even if this was not the case before. Thus, the migration background variable as applied in SOEP-IS takes a retrospective perspective and will be updated every year.

Ethnic German repatriates (“Spät-/Aussiedler”) in this classification are coded '[2] Direct Migration Background'. Foreigners who were born in Germany and naturalized are coded '[3] Indirect Migration Background'.
