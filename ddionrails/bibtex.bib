   abstract = {The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) is a useful tool for evaluating short-term changes in emotional experiences over a variety of daily situations. However, traditional method of collecting DRM data can be time-intensive for both researchers and participants. In this paper we provide evidence that a random-sampling approach to DRM assessment can provide useful data that are largely consistent with previous research that used the full version of the DRM. In a nationally representative sample of 2303 people, we demonstrate that (1) there is variability in emotional ratings of episodes that replicates what has been found in prior studies, (2) correlations with global measures are typically small in magnitude (<0.30), (3) correlations with personality are for the most part negligible, (4) correlations with global ratings of domain satisfaction are higher for domain-relevant situations, and (5) parents report more positive affect while providing care for their children when compared to other activities, and this effect can account for the observed differences in emotional experiences of parents and non-parents. },

   abstract = {In the following we aim to approach the question of why, in most domains of professional and economic life, women are more vulnerable than men to becoming targets of prejudice and discrimination by proposing that one important cause of this inequality is the presence of gender stereotypes in many domains of society. We describe two approaches employed to measure gender stereotypes: An explicit questionnaire based on rating scales and a newly developed Implicit Association Test assessing gender stereotypes representing instrumentality (i.e., agency) and expressivity (i.e., communion). We first present information on psychometric properties of each stereotype measure designed for this purpose. We then present preliminary data based on the SOEP Innovation Sample 2011 indicating differences in explicit stereotypes with reference to occupational position and income. Implicit stereotypic associations concerning expressivity increased with respondents’ age and stereotypic associations concerning instrumentality increased with household income, particularly among male participants. Finally, stereotypic associations were related simultaneously to occupational position and participants’ gender, such that differences between male and female participants were found in lower occupational positions for the Expressivity IAT and in higher occupational positions for the Instrumentality IAT. This finding indicates that individually held gender stereotypes are related to socioeconomic and social variables.},

Drawing on an experimental research design, we studied the effect of this switch in the method of data collection on measurement invariance as well as measurement error and interviewer effects in the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS). Although in some cases we found slightly stronger associations between interviewer and respondent personality in face-to-face settings, the results generally suggested strict measurement invariance–and therefore full comparability–across methods of data collection.},

   abstract = {Kushlev, Dunn, and Lucas (2015) found that income predicts less daily sadness—but not greater happiness—among Americans. The present study used longitudinal data from an approximately representative German sample to replicate and extend these findings. Our results largely replicated Kushlev et al.’s results: Income predicted less daily sadness (albeit with a smaller effect size) but was unrelated to happiness. Moreover, the association between income and sadness could not be explained by demographics, stress, or daily time use. Extending Kushlev et al.’s findings, new analyses indicated that only between-persons variance in income (but not within-persons variance) predicted daily sadness—perhaps because there was relatively little within-persons variance in income. Finally, income predicted less daily sadness and worry, but not less anger or frustration—potentially suggesting that income predicts less “internalizing” but not less “externalizing” negative emotions. Together, our study and Kushlev et al.’s study provide evidence that income robustly predicts select daily negative emotions—but not positive ones.},

The approaches bear some similarities, but differ in that the CA attaches more importance to autonomy and highlights the indirect effects of social influence. In contrast to TPB, the CA suggests indirect norm effects (on behavior) by shaping attitudes and the perception of freedom of choice. Furthermore, the CA hints at the motivational power of personal autonomy for behavioral choices. We develop a combined model to test our assumptions for two sustainable consumption behaviors (i.e., purchase of organic food and mobility behavior). Testing the combined model based on cross-sectional data of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP-IS) confirms the significance of the CA for sustainable consumption. The policy implications of the findings are enhancing people's opportunities for sustainable consumption in order to strengthen sustainable behavior.},

   abstract = {The paper introduces a short scale for measuring attitudes to four fundamental principles of the just distribution of benefits and burdens in a society. The Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale is an eight-item scale that measures agreement with the equality, equity, need, and entitlement principle. In contrast to comparable other scales that have been used in justice research in the past, the BSJO scale is consistent with the current state of empirical justice research andallows for the study of the constructs distinguished by studies in that area and, more specifically, in the context of population surveys and with respect to societal distribution conflicts. The paper reports the methodological aspects of the construction and use of the scale in population surveys, as well as results concerning reliability and construct validation. The study uses data from three general social surveys that have been conducted in Germany: LINOS-1, SOEP Innovation Sample 2012, and ALLBUS 2014. The analysis of these three data sets confirms the assumed four-factorial structure of the justice dimensions, and the validation of the construct confirms the hypothesized relationships between the dimensions of the BSJO scale and socio-structural characteristics, political attitudes, and other justice related attitudes.},

   abstract = {The Motivational Theory of Life-Span Development (MTD) identifies motivational and self-regulatory strategies that people use to meet the challenges they face throughout life. The theory distinguishes control strivings related to goal engagement from those related to goal disengagement and goal reengagement. In the Innovation Sample of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS), these control strivings were surveyed using 12-item scales for key domains of life: work, family, and health. In this report, we first present key concepts and principles of MTD and a brief overview of research using the theory. This provides the backdrop for our discussion of the relevance of control strivings for major thematic areas covered in the SOEP and for the proposed domain-specific assessment of control strivings. Second, we examine the reliability and factor structure of the scales, using data from the SOEP Innovation Sample collected in 2012. In a third and final step, we sketch possible projects that make use of the rich SOEP data so as to examine pivotal questions revolving around the nature of control strivings (changes) across adulthood and old age as well as their antecedents, correlates, and consequences. In line with predictions based on MTD, results revealed mostly moderate to high inter-item correlations for selective primary control, selective secondary control, and compensatory primary control, with all items loading on a single goal engagement factor. Our results further show that disengagement, self-protection and re-engagement are interrelated, but distinguishable strategies for dealing with unattainable goals.},

   abstract = {This study examines the effect of justice sensitivity on the life satisfaction and job-seeking behavior of unemployed individuals and considers the likelihood of experiencing long-term unemployment. We focus on two facets of dispositional justice sensitivity that reflect individual differences in perception and reactions to perpetrating injustice against others (perpetrator sensitivity) or suffering from the injustice of others as an innocent victim (victim sensitivity). We hypothesised that the negative effect of unemployment on life satisfaction is stronger among individuals with higher levels of victim sensitivity and perpetrator sensitivity. The former are more likely to perceive themselves as victims of an unjust situation, such as fate or the employer's decisions, whereas the latter are more likely to perceive themselves as perpetrators against the rules of social justice. Using survey data from approximately 400 participants, we found that unemployed individuals were less satisfied with life than employed individuals and that this relationship was stronger for perpetrator-sensitive individuals. Unemployed perpetrator-sensitive individuals were more likely to engage in active job-seeking behavior and faced a lower likelihood of long-term unemployment. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of justice-related personality aspects of unemployed individuals for their well-being and labor market outcomes.},
